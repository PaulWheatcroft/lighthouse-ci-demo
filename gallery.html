            <h2>Exploring the beauty of lighthouses</h2>
            <p>These images showcase a diverse range of lighthouse settings and conditions, illustrating their historical significance, architectural variety, and role in maritime safety. The collection includes classic coastal lighthouses, such as those perched on rocky cliffs, sandy beaches, and grassy hills, emphasizing their picturesque beauty and navigational function. Other images highlight modern advancements, such as solar-powered lighthouses, which represent sustainability in maritime infrastructure. Additionally, some lighthouses are depicted in dramatic weather conditions, including dense fog, winter ice, and stormy seas, illustrating their importance in guiding ships safely through treacherous waters.</p>
            <p>Beyond active lighthouses, the collection also features abandoned and weathered structures, showcasing the historical remnants of once-essential navigation aids. These images reflect the passage of time, with rusted exteriors, broken windows, and overgrown surroundings, symbolizing the transition from traditional lighthouse keepers to automated technology. The variety in these images makes them useful for performance testing, as they include different lighting, color contrasts, and levels of detail, which can challenge rendering speeds and optimize website efficiency when analyzed using Lighthouse CI.</p>
