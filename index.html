            <h2>A history of lighthouses</h2>
            <p>Lighthouses have played a crucial role in maritime navigation for thousands of years, guiding sailors safely through treacherous waters and marking hazardous coastlines. The earliest known lighthouses date back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. The most famous early lighthouse was the Lighthouse of Alexandria, built in the 3rd century BCE on the island of Pharos in Egypt. Standing over 100 meters tall, it was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. This monumental structure used fire and polished bronze mirrors to project light across the sea, warning and directing ships approaching the busy port of Alexandria.</p>
            <p>During the Middle Ages, lighthouses saw a decline in development due to reduced maritime trade and political instability. However, as European exploration expanded in the 15th and 16th centuries, there was a renewed need for navigational aids. Coastal nations like Portugal, Spain, and England invested in lighthouse construction to support their growing fleets. Early medieval lighthouses were often simple structures with open flames or iron braziers burning coal or wood. These fires, while helpful, were often unreliable in bad weather. By the late Renaissance period, advancements in optics and engineering led to the development of enclosed lantern rooms, improving the visibility and consistency of lighthouse signals.</p>
            <p>The 18th and 19th centuries marked the golden age of lighthouse construction, driven by technological innovations and increased global trade. The invention of the Fresnel lens in 1822 by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel revolutionized lighthouse illumination. This groundbreaking lens used concentric rings of glass prisms to concentrate and project light much farther than previous methods. As a result, lighthouses became more powerful and effective, reducing shipwrecks and increasing maritime safety. During this period, nations like the United States, Britain, and France built hundreds of lighthouses along their coasts, establishing organized lighthouse services to maintain and operate them.</p>
            <p>With the advent of the 20th century, lighthouses continued to evolve, incorporating electricity, automated systems, and radio beacons. The introduction of electric lights replaced traditional oil and gas lamps, significantly increasing brightness and reliability. Automation gradually reduced the need for lighthouse keepers, who had historically lived in isolation to maintain the lights. By the mid-20th century, many lighthouses were fully automated, using sensors and timers to control their operation. Despite these advancements, the role of lighthouses began to decline with the rise of modern navigation technologies such as GPS, radar, and electronic chart systems.</p>
            <p>Today, while fewer lighthouses are actively used for navigation, they remain cultural and historical landmarks around the world. Many have been preserved as museums or tourist attractions, celebrating their rich history and architectural beauty. Some still serve as backup aids to navigation, particularly in remote areas where electronic systems may fail. The legacy of lighthouses continues to inspire maritime enthusiasts, engineers, and historians, reminding us of the ingenuity and perseverance of those who built and maintained these beacons of light for centuries.</p>
